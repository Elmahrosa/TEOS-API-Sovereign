## Sovereign API Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

APIs do not decide.  
APIs do not govern.  
APIs do not bypass sovereignty.

This gateway exposes **execution interfaces only**
after sovereign approval has occurred upstream.

APIs, SDKs, AI, and Web3 systems are **execution instruments** —
never sources of authority.

---

## What This Repository Is

- **Canonical REST / OpenAPI specifications**
- **Official governed SDKs** (JavaScript, Python, future languages)
- **Strict binding to sovereign execution outcomes**
- **Audit-ready request and response envelopes**
- **Nation-configurable access and jurisdiction profiles**

> No external system may interact with TEOS  
> without using this gateway.
