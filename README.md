# Governed API & SDK Gateway of the TEOS Sovereign Stack

**Law authorizes.**  
**Governance defines rules.**  
**Core validates access.**  
**The API exposes — under control.**

</div>

---
# ⚖️ Governance — Elmahrosa International / TEOS

## Governance Model

Elmahrosa International operates under a **constitution-first governance model**.

Authority flows strictly **top-down**:

```

International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)
↓
TEOS Governance Logic
↓
Execution Systems

```

No repository, maintainer, or automation may override constitutional authority.

---

## Root of Trust

The **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)** is the sole Root of Trust.

All governance logic, policies, and execution rules derive their legitimacy from it.

---

## Decision Authority

| Level | Authority |
|---|---|
| Constitutional | ICBC |
| Governance Logic | TEOS-Governance |
| Execution | Elmahrosa-Core & Sovereign Systems |

Automation **executes** authority — it never creates it.

---

## Changes & Amendments

- Constitutional changes follow ICBC-defined procedures
- Governance logic changes must remain compliant
- Execution changes are invalid if governance is breached

---

## Forking & Derivatives

Forking constitutional or governance repositories **does not confer legitimacy**.

Only repositories maintained under Elmahrosa International
retain sovereign validity.

---

## Final Principle

> **Law governs code.  
> Authority governs execution.  
> Governance governs change.**

## 🏛️ Repository Standing

**TEOS-API-Sovereign** is the **single governed API and SDK gateway**
of the TEOS ecosystem.

It is the **only authorized interface** through which external systems,
institutions, partners, or nations may interact with
TEOS sovereign execution capabilities.

This repository:
- ❌ Does NOT create authority  
- ❌ Does NOT execute actions  
- ❌ Does NOT define governance  

It exposes **strictly controlled access** to
**already-authorized and validated execution paths**.

- **Chain Position:** #5 — Governed API / SDK Gateway  
- **Authority Source (ICBC):**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/Teos-International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution  
- **Governance Stewardship:**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/TEOS-FORGE  
- **Execution Validation:**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/Elmahrosa-Core  
- **Execution Kernel:**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/Teos-Sovereign-System  

⚠️ **APIs expose authority — they never create it.**
