## Sovereign Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

Elmahrosa defines governance.  
Nations retain authority.  
Technology executes under control.

APIs, SDKs, AI, and Web3 systems are **execution instruments** —
never sources of sovereignty.
