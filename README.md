# Governed API & SDK Gateway of the TEOS Sovereign Stack

**Law authorizes.**  
**Governance defines rules.**  
**Core validates access.**  
**The API exposes — under control.**

</div>

## 🏛️ Repository Standing

**TEOS-API-Sovereign** is the **single governed API and SDK gateway**
of the TEOS ecosystem.

It is the **only authorized interface** through which external systems,
institutions, partners, or nations may interact with
TEOS sovereign execution capabilities.

This repository:
- ❌ Does NOT create authority  
- ❌ Does NOT execute actions  
- ❌ Does NOT define governance  

It exposes **strictly controlled access** to
**already-authorized and validated execution paths**.

- **Chain Position:** #5 — Governed API / SDK Gateway  
- **Authority Source (ICBC):**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/Teos-International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution  
- **Governance Stewardship:**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/TEOS-FORGE  
- **Execution Validation:**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/Elmahrosa-Core  
- **Execution Kernel:**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/Teos-Sovereign-System  

⚠️ **APIs expose authority — they never create it.**
